<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics. In 1974, he gave a Caltech <a href="https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/archive/tesfatsi/CargoCultScience.RichardFeynman1974.pdf">commencement addres</a> in which he told a story of a society that wants progress, and does what it imagines are the necessary steps for progress, but progress never happens because they lack “scientific integrity.” Feynman explains,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It's a kind of scientific integrity,
a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of
leaning over backwards. For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report
everything that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about
it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that
you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked--to make sure the
other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.</p>
  <p>Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them.
You must do the best you can--if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong--
to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you
must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. [...]</p>
  <p>In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others to judge the value
of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgement in one particular
direction or another. [...]</p>
  <p>But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves--of having utter scientific
integrity--is, I'm sorry to say, something that we haven't specifically included in any
particular course that I know of. We just hope you've caught on by osmosis.</p>

<pp>Going beyond the hope of teching scientific integrity through osmosis, this essay proposes that Google's <a href="https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist">co-scientist</a> AI agent is an exciting and practical approach to developing scientific integrity that Feynan was hoping for.</pp>
